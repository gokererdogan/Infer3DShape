# Inferring 3D Shape from 2D images
**NOTE THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS**
This library implements a MH sampler for inferring the 3D shape of a particular class of objects from 2D images. The
objects are assumed to be made up of cube-like parts. 

This model is implemented as part of an ongoing research project.
