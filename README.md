# Inferring 3D Shape from 2D images

This library implements a MH sampler for inferring the 3D shape of a particular class of objects from 2D images. The
objects are assumed to be made up of rectangular blocks or tubes. 
Note that this library depends on these other repositories
- gmllib
- mcmclib (Used for running MCMC chains)
- BDAoOSS_ShapeGrammar (Required only for BDAoOSSShape and BDAoOSSShapeMaxD classes)
- ShapeGrammar (Required only for BDAoOSSShape and BDAoOSSShapeMaxD classes)

This model is implemented as part of an ongoing research project.
